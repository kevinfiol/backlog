    <p>We all have less time than we used to. And as the years fly by, so do all those new releases. It's a blessing -- you've never had so much great content to consume! And yet, a curse... how could you ever complete all of that? Never has there been a more apt use of the phrase, "first world problems."</p>

    <p>My efforts led me to keep a simple list (written and updated publicly using Markdown). While it mostly worked, I knew I desired something more dynamic and domain-specific.</p>
